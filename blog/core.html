        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      </div>
        <div class="article">
          <div>
            <h6>My definition of Emtional Intelligence</h6>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is the capacity to acknowledge and not act on emotions while also handling interpersonal relationship empathically and respectfully without judgment. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h6>Difference from IQ</h6>
            <p>Simply put the difference between IQ and EQ IQ is what we think, and EQ is how we think. IQ is the ability to solve problems, use logic, understand, and resolve complex ideas using one’s intelligence. Whereas EQ is the ability to recognize emotion absorb information without judgement and adapt your actions to emotion of yourself and others.</p>
            <p>The best visual example of this I find is a clip from the TV show young Sheldon when Sheldon and his twin sister (Missy) are begin tested and given the same test in different rooms.</p>
            <video controls="controls">
              <source src="/videos/Untitled.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
            </video>
            <p>As we can see in the video clip Sheldon excels with logical and mathematical problem solving and Missy excels at identifying the emotions of the apes shown in the picture and throughout the clip display emotional intelligence with the professor. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h6>Why is EQ important?</h6>
            <p>Benefits of emotional intelligence are that you’re it heightens ones understanding of themselves and others. This is a benefit because by understanding what emotions you are feeling and how to adapt to each one stops them from taking over and becoming confused and unfocused. For example, If you got angry you would be able to prevent yourself from lashing out, punching things, or even hurting people. Knowing when you are angry what can happen and how to avoid negative situations can be very advantageous when working on projects and problem solving.</p>
            <p>But there is also the ability to understand the emotions of others, recognising when someone is sad or angry, we can use emotional intelligence to help them adapt to their own emotions. Which can improve productivity within a workplace.</p>
            <p>A great example of the benefits of interpersonal skills is Elon Musk’s who openly states that “he would rather a group of slightly intelligent people who work well together rather than a group of highly intelligent people who do not work well together”. This is because the group who work well together can understand respect and acknowledge each other’s strengths and weaknesses leading to productivity. Whereas the group of highly intelligent people often have tendencies to prove their the smartest and will avoid work with others and not asking for help, slowing down productivity.</p>

      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="article">
      
        <div>
            <h5>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h5>
            <p>My current plan is to gain a strong understanding and experience with software programming to eventually work remotely while travelling.</p>
            <p>Longer term i would like to be able to comfortable work with the thriving and innnovative new techologies that are rising such as Web 3, crypto, and metaverse</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h5>
          <p>When it comes to learning i have alwways been a more kenisthetic and auditorial learner. Meaning if i am too be shown how to do things and find it much easier to understand and put into practice. Unfortunately with these being my strengths one of my weaknesses in learning is more visual, typically when it comes to understand text and reading due to a visual dyslexia I have. however, i find that my best learning technique is repetition do things over and over again improves my memory and understanding of the subject.</p> 
          <p>Outside of learning techniques, so of my strengths and learning within a group and wokring with others face to face and also i have a good memory for things i perform practically. Whereas my weaknesses are that i never think i know enough, causing anxiety and worry about my wokr which is usually acceptable. This issue has caused some academic failures, but not due to incompetence but due to late submissions and having little confidence in my studies.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h5>
        <p>Greater confidence in my ability as a software programmer which would lead me to having less anxiety around others and when working for a company. Also the abiliity to accept imperfection and ask for help instead of spending wasted time researching results.</p> 
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h5>
      <h7>a. An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representative</h7><!--Was unsure how to answer this quesiton-->
      <p>By being respectful, helpful, and protray honesty in times of confusion allowing others to help.</p> 
      <h7>b. What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h7>
      <p>Much like this project issues and problems do happen and can frustrate me and during this week i attempted differnt methods of getting past the frustration. Most effective was stopping and going away from my computer and doingg exercise be it a walk and a quick surf at the beach. Then when i came back would look over my work, assess what i was trying to do, figure out best method of doing it and find the issues that occured.</p>
      <p>This method was most useful and enjoyable (I got smashed by waves) because it was something differnt and a nice break away from that which frustrated me.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5>5. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h5>
    <p>Greater confidence in my ability as a software programmer which would lead me to having less anxiety around others and when working for a company. Also the ability to accept imperfection and ask for help instead of spending wasted time researching results.</p> 
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5>6. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h5>
    <p>I have been trying to commit to 10-15min self research and trialing when it comes to an uncertain issue. if the issue is not resolved then i should be going to the discord channels asking other students for assistance. If not the facillitators if in a rush.</p> 
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5>7. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h5>
    <p>I expect the facilitators to be guiding their students through the sprint curriculums and ensuring that they comprhend and understand their tasks. While not always being in contact and relying on the students to teach the students is a very strong teaching method i believe that for the more shy beginners may struggle and take longer to embrace this learning style.</p> 
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5>8. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h5>
    <p>Day to day I aim for 8 hours of study and practice which is spilt into 2x 4 hour intervals seperated by lunch and exercise, smaller breaks when necesary.</p>
    <p>This leaves 8 hours left wihtin the day for extramurial activites such as house work and recreational activites (surfing). Typically about 2 hours of this time is commmited to any form of movement/exercise as to maintain physical helath.</p>
    <p>In the case of not completeing the necesary hours of study. some late afternoon study may be required. as well as in the event of a day off for a little rest and relaxation. or even in the case of too much study so time on the next day may be taken out to  aintain a helahty worklife balance.</p>

        <h1>Identity</h1>
     </div>

      <div class="article">
        <div class="value">
          <h6>Connection</h6>

            <p>What I think this value means connections with others be them friends’ family or colleagues. Connection creates a sense of belonging, inclusion and unity with those around me while having a safeguard feeling that there are others to support and assist me when I struggle. </p>

            <p>This value I believe originates from a human instinct but also having siblings gave a long sense of always having someone with me and always doing activities with others and therefore created a desire for connection away from home. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="value">
          <h6>Experience</h6>

            <p>Being past present or future experience provides knowledge and understanding no matter how positive or negative the experience may be. The more you do and more you witness I believe you become more understanding of various situations creating empathy and stronger relationships. </p>

           <p class="center quote">Albert Einstein <em>“The only source of knowledge is Experience”</em></p>

            <p>This quote summarises what it means to gain experiences both good and bad. Much like learning from mistakes every experience always has a lesson to teach no matter how small.</p> 
        </div>

        <div class="value">
          <h6>Respect</h6>

           <p>I value respect, respect towards others and self-respect not only due to its nature of kindness, honesty, and compassion towards others but also how it impacts oneself. By respecting myself I sense a stronger obligation to improving wellbeing and enjoying more of what life has to offer. </p> 

           <p>This value I believe is to be derived from the way I was raised and experiencing situations where lack of respect creates situations such as bullying, negative self-talk, misunderstandings and creates a domino effect towards hate and disrespect.</p>
          
            <p class="center quote">Martin Luther King <em>”I am convinced that men hate each other because they fear each other. They fear each other because they don’t know each other and they don’t know each other because they don’t communicate with each other, and they don’t communicate with each other because they are separated from each other.”</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="value">
          <h6>Knowledge</h6>
            <p>Knowledge can be gained from many different teachers, be it primary education, librarians, workplace colleagues, experiences, time, knowledge can be gathered a every turn. I collect knowledge as a tool to help raise myself above struggle and conflict towards a resolution efficiently and productively. However, the versatility of knowledge can be used as a tool, or a weapon and it is up to the wielder to decide which. as a tool it can be used to build a rocket to reach the stars or to collect information about an enemy’s plan and decide best course of action for best outcomes.</p>
            <p>I gather knowledge to be resourceful, adaptable, intelligent and understanding because these traits make it possible for me to best help others and provide positive experiences and resolutions. Therefore, I use knowledge as a tool to assist those around me and therefore be my better self.</p> 
        </div>

        <div class="value">
          <h6>Adventure</h6>	
            <p>Adventure has always been a strong value of mine, and to mean adventure means getting out and exploring new experiences and being active. Adventure also provides a sense of unity and connection with the earth which I believe comes from the primal human nature.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="value">
            <h6>Independence</h6>	
            <p>Despite having the stronger Connection Value, I also value those that can be	 independent and can do things on their own. Those that are independent don’t require assistance from others all the time and have the capabilities of performing tasks, and if they aren’t capable, they know how to become capable.</p> 
          </div>
          
        <div class="strengths">
            <h6>Strengths</h6>
              <p>Friendly, loyal, work great in a team , can step up to lead, jack of all trades, adaptable, fast learner when shown (kinesthetic and auditory learner, good with short text and great with numbers).</p>
        </div>  
        <div class="strengths">
            <h6>Limtiations</h6>
              <p>Anxiety around new people. Sometimes afraid to ask for help, visual dyslexia processing large amounts of text. Struggle with interpretation of some sentences but as soon as sound it out or talk it over can comprehend well.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h6>Ethical Decision</h6>
            <p>A strong ethical decision we all must make is where we want to go in life and what we want to do. These decisions have many different influences from various sources such as family friends, government, laws, and of course personal <br>
              For example. For a long time during high school, I always wanted to work in the adventure tourism industry because I would be required o do physical work and have fun jumping of cliffs, riding down mountains and being in nature. This fed my Balance, Adventure, Experience and Connection values. <br>
                Because of these values I then choose to attend a Tertiary study programme that would better equip myself to join and thrive in the industry. This led me to researching and experiencing what different tertiary programmes had to offer and I needed to decide which one best suited me and lined up with my values. <br>
              My 3 choices became Otago Uni, Queenstown Resort College (QRC) and New Zealand School of Tourism (NZST). Each provided me with strong Experience and knowledge of the industry which aligned with two of my values. <br>
              <br>Otago – focus on the skills of the outdoor adventure guide for kayaking, rock climbing, tramping, skiing – all great areas that would allow me to travel, meet and learn with likeminded people (Adventure and Connection) <br>
              <br>NZST – focus on extreme outdoor sports and extreme conditions, smaller course intake (less connection, narrow experience, independence) <br>
              <br> QRC – focus on Adventure Tourism more about how to run a tourism business - marketing, HR, business financials plus experience in a huge variety of outdoor pursuits (adventure, independence, connection). It offered a more whole person and whole business opportunity. <br>
              <br>After weighing my personal values and the values I would get out of each provider, I decided to go with QRC as it aligned with more of my values allowing for the best fit. <br>

          <h6>Personal Experience of handling tension wihtin a group </h6>
          <p>During my time at Cromwell College, I participated in a programme called B.L.A.S.T. which was essentially a way to give high school students a military experience. Doing drills, marching practice, and circuit physical training. towards the end of this programme we were all spilt into small groups of 6-7 and were to run a orientation course across the time for most of the day. I, being the eldest in the programme was given the task of Team Leader and given the more troublesome students. The ones that would not get along with anyone and rebel as often as they could. Some may think this was unfair, but the head teacher and I had already discussed this plan as to not allow these students to disrupt the other groups. </p>
          <p>Now during the orientation activity these students consistently argued and fought and were being very disruptive, not allowing us to complete tasks or move efficiently. Unfortunately, i did have not use a more aggressive leadership style and tell the students what to do instead of suggesting and assign tasks appropriately. Once I had separated the two more troublesome students and given them simplistic and meaningful tasks such as setting the speed of the group and giving the best direction. </p>
          <p>The techniques I used to handle the tension and conflict within the group was to give everyone their own tasks away from each other to avoid collisions. Unfortunately I did have to take away the students right to speak up because he had lost the trust and reliance of his team mates.</p>
          <p>These methods to stop the disruptive behaviour of the students was surprisingly effective and to not only our teams surprise by the surprise of all those watching our team managed to win the orientation and complete the course much more efficiently than the other teams. Reflecting on how I acted in that situations I’m proud that I was able to take charge more firmly and get the students to start working productively. However, I did not enjoy having to be angry with the students and taking away their opportunities to speak up.</p>
