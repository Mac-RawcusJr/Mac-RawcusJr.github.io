          <h6>Simple Problem</h6>
            <p>
              During an open class coding activity during my EDA course I was struggling with one of the most simple questions and felt really frustrated with myself during the whole process and after I figured out the simple answer. 
            </p> 
            <p>
              This was one of the first question when I had to give a value to a variable and usually when you first create a variable you give it some sort of value whether it be a number or words or even a sentence. However, this tasks was to assign value to these variables without editing the code around the variables themselves. I originally thought that It was a trick question and therefore, edited the variables themselves to give the values. But then I thought no it's not a trick question and tried to figure out how to change the values outside of the variables. This is where the frustration began.
            </p>

            <p>
              I spent so long trying to figure out how to change the values with complex code that I was researching and still couldn't past the test. I felt a bit ashamed of not having being able to do something so simple I walked away and distracted myself with other things for a while. I then came back and looked at the problem and realised what I had been doing the entire time. I was over thinkng everything. I then went back to some of my earlier research from when I first started the EDA course and within 2 mins o watching one of the videos I had realised the what I had been doing wrong. The solution was so simple and right in front of me that I over looked it and got frustrated for no reason. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem with this situation is that I over thought everything and missed the simple solution. I also wasted a lot of time and got frustrated, unable to do much other work.  I learnt from this experience that I have to slow down and keep things simple while also understanding the problems better. 
            </p>

          <h6>Elegant problem Solving</h6>
            <p>
              Theres was a day where  wsa tasked with taking the recycling to the recycling center to get rid of it and this task would take roughly an hour. So I thought to myself that I would put on a load of my washing before I left so that when I got back I could hang it out. And this is where my problems began.
            </p> 
            <p>
              To do my washing I had to put my clothes in the machine which was full, so I had to put those clothes into a basket which was also full of folded sheets and rugs. So to do these away I would put them on the shelf in the laundry but at the time needing new carpet being put down so the shelf was in the middle of the laundry. So instead this lead to having to do the carpet, to move the shelving, to put away the sheets and rugs to empty the washing machine to do my own washing so I could go and do the recycling.
              
            </p>

            <p>
              I found this to be elegant problem solving because I did not overthink any situation and when I came across a problem I figured out how to fix it and continue on with my task.  I figured out my goal (to put washing on) and discovered the tasks I needed to do (unload machine, put sheets away etc, etc) and one by one I completed the tasks and the goal. So thought out the process I didn’t feel frustrated or rushed and I was confident in my abilities to solve each problem.  From this exchange I learnt that as you work towards your goal it is best to solve each problem one at a time and go with the flow while maintaining and visualising your final goal.

        <h6>Different problem solving techniques and processes</h6>

        	<p>
            I beleive that there is no onne strategy to solve a problem instead i believe that a collection of techinques and processes are useed to solve problems and depending on the problem you could use a different combination of techinques. My method of problem solving would be to run through an algorithum chart of techniques strating with simple methods such as Reading Error Code then Try Something then console.logging then Googling. Therefore i feel confident using all methods of problemsolving and therefore ca use each one depeding on the difficulty of the problem. 
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if i had say which ones i struggle with the most it would be asking others fro help such as peers and facilitators. because i feel that by asking for help your not only admitting that you have a problem but that i slao have an inability to understand and solve the problem. THis is a very poor mindset to have and i reccomned to all those struggling with speaking up and asking for help to not stress and just do it. Its difficult yes but the mores times you ask for help the more confident you will be at it in the future.

     <!--JavaScript Post-------------------------------->

          <h6>Javascript and its relation to CSS and HTML</h6>
            <p>Java Script (not the same as Java) is a method of giving computers instructions that improve user interactions from a functionaltiy perspecive similarly to CSS. Java script allows us to update content, keep track of events (events beings clicks, mouse movement, etc.), deeper inspections of webpages, animate objects and various other cool tricks.</p>

            <p>When comparing JS to CSS and HTML javascript is more like CSS, making the webpage flow nicer for the viewers and give them best access and assistance while also providing the owner with valuable information about its usage.</p>
            
            <p>If we were to use a house analogy where the Html is the bone structure of the house and the CSS is the paint and decoration i would say that Javascript provides the lightswitches, fusebox, hot water cylinder, taps and other inbuilt appliances that are usful to making a house helathy and livable. This is because Javascript is not really visual but wokrs more in the background providing small yet useful and effective aspects that really imporve a website / house.  </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>Control Flow and Loops</h6>
          <!-- Use everyDay examples -------->  
          <p>Control flow is the sequence at which the conmputer reads the code and in what order they are out into action. the default Control flow order is typically from top to bottom until you write out specific code that tells the computer to prioritize this bit of code over some others. </p><p>Changing the Control Flow seems to mostly happen when we use Loops. Loops are pieces of code the instruct the computer to repeat a certain peice of code until instructed to stop or the result becomes false. We use loops for various situations but the most simple way is to instruct a computer to comb through <em><a href="#array">arrays</a></em> of information and can perform a step by step process of dealing with that information.</p>
          <p>Loops are like your morning routine and the activator is your alarm, your alarm goes off which instructs you to wake up, then shower, get dressed, have breakfast, then head to work. its a consistant loop that when activiated performs a series of actions. And control flow is a more broader version of loops with less routine.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
          <h6>The DOM</h6>
            <p>The Document Object Model is a translated and simplified diagram of a Webpages HTML element/object hierarchy. The DOM can also be used to create interactions and events such as a submit button or load more option that does not require the entire page to refresh. You can think of the DOM as a translation of html so that other languages such as JavaScript and CSS can understand it better, or vice versa. 
              <p>The Dom can often be shown as a diagram displaying the documents element relations between parent and child elements. Much like the diagram shown here:</p>
              <img src="/images/DOM-diagram.png" alt="DOM Diagram" id="dom-diagram" class="center">
              <p>This diagram shows that the HEAD and BODY elements are the children of HTML. So when we use CSS to change how an element appears or positioned we use element tags that locate the specific element were after on the DOM diagram. 
              </p>
          </div>
            
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h6 id="array">Accessing Data from arrays and objects</h6>
             <p>Arrays and Objects are both used to store collections of information to be accessed at later dates. What seprates the two is how the store information, arrays being differenct values under a single varaiable whereas an object is more specific and contains a list of different variables each with their own values. This also means that we can have Arrays inside of objects because a variable can have more than one value.</p>
            
            <b>Arrays</b>

             <p>An array is often displayed within squared brackets ([array]) and can be very useful when we have multiple values. As we can see in this photo we have an 2 arrays with 3 values in each.</p>
             <img src="/images/array syntax.png" alt="array-syntax" class="center">
             <p>When trying to access these values the computer has already assigned numerical values to each value and it always starts with <em>0</em>. There when calling the value 1 = [0], 2 = [1] and 3 = [2]. Somtimes wehen we have arrays within arrays we can access them the same way but create a sort of path with the numerical values. if i wanted to access the value Mac it would be <em>array([1][0])</em> the 1 is for the first set of square brackets and the 0 is for the value Mac. </p>

            <b>Objects</b>

              <p>Objects can be accessed by writing a pathway to the specific code were after and we can use either Dont notation or bracket notation each describing the pathway to the data. We can also change the value of properties using push, pop and shift codes depending on how we wish to affect the data collection.</p>
                <img src="/images/Object syntax.png" alt="object-syntax" class="center">
        </div>
          
        
        <div>
          <h6>Functions</h6>
             <p>Functions are one of javascripts greatest tools as they can be used to perform a sequence of particular task and summaraized into a simplar smaller piece of code if needed.</p>
             <img src="/images/functions.png" alt="Functions Example" class="center" id="functions-img">
             <p>As we can see in this image we have created a function that when activated using <em></em>newFunction</em> porperty it will take the two values within sum them up and return the total value.</p>

        <h6>What is the position property?</h6>
        <p>The position property manipulates an elements position within the webpage.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>Relative</h6>
          <p>According to W3 School relative positioning “is positioned relative to its normal position.” 
            The positioning allows an element to be positioned relative to its default spot. So, you can move an element in direction any amount of distance and not be affected by many other elements. However, this position style won’t work without further coding giving the element instructions on where to move to. This means that the top, right, bottom, and left
          </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h6>Fixed</h6>
            <p>A Fixed position makes the elements position relative to the viewpoint of the web page.  In simple terms this positioning makes an element stay still on a screen even if you are scrolling and moving around on the actual webpage the element will stay in the same place. 
              An example of this is typical a menu option on a page that stays tucked away in a corner available for use no matter where you go on a page. 
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h6>Absolute</h6>
              <p>Relative positioning is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed)  
              </p>
              <div class="image">
              <img src="/images/css-position-all.png" alt="css-positioning-diagram" id="css-positioning-diagram">
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>This diagram provides a visual example of how each position affects an element. As we can see a relative position is adjusted from its default position. An absolute position is determined by the distance from margins but still can be scrolled passed unlike and a fixed position which is also determined by the distance from margins but will stay in the spot even while scrolling. </p>
