    <h1>Core Reflections</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="article">
    <div>
      <h5>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning</h5>
        <p>
          One of the topics I enjoyed most about the core components was the identity section in sprint 1 where I was able to discover more about myself and gain some insight into my values which lead to an deeper understanding of myself. Also during the 1st sprint it was great to put more effort into understanding my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to learning. This allowed me to work on my learning understandings so as I was studying and learning I could work on my weaknesses and use my strengths to help my learning. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h5>
        <p>
          Communication is a big thing when it comes to work in a group, students learning, and teachers teaching. Being able to communicate with others allows for clearer understanding of the task at hand. Understanding what your values are allows you to understand how you approach  and interact with others who have different values and ethics. This is where empathy comes in, being able think of others and understand their positions allows you to better communicate with one another. So being aware of yourself and others allows for clearer communication and easier understanding and better cooperation. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h5>
        <p>
          The depth at which the focus on mental awareness is for this industry is surprising especially since ive never experience such awareness on this large of scale. However, it is not just the awareness that surprises me but also the techniques towards self-improvement for better cooperation between multiple people.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h5>
        <p>
          In the past I have avoided and been quite shy about talking about myself especially to others so it has been quite a struggle doing blog posts that talk about myself and who I am. Even though I understand this is quite a crucial step towards being a good problem solver and worker within programming industry so even though this was a struggle I still made it through which makes it just a little easier every time.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h5>
        <p>
          I'm not sure on the proper answer but my best guess is that it is too ensure the mental health of those within the industry while also improving their productivity independently and within groups. This may be due to the weight of learning all there is in the industry. From experience and other peoples stories the tech industry can be quite trying at times and be mentally straining sitting at a computer and working so much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, Understanding more about yourself and how you can be most productive when problem solving and working within a group. This is why understanding your core fundamentals can improve your future productivity.   
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer</h5>
        <p>
          A lot of the core tasks and activities were great towards understanding more about oneself and best ways to problem solve. Also learning different techniques towards improving your mental skills was a great eye opener. However, we did do many more core blog posts compared to tech blog posts and I would have liked to learn more about the programming side and technical skills of the industry and more technical practice similar to the JavaScript challenges we did in sprint 5. So I definitely would have loved to do more practical technical skills that improved my work flow, code flow and expanded my understanding of different tags elements and functions that I could use in my code.  So that I can better create clean and un repetitive code because when I look at my blog code now I realise how messy my code is and have struggled to try change and clean up the code.

    <div class="h1">
      <h1>Learning Plan Updated</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="article">
      <div>
        <h5>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h5>
          <p>
            In terms of career path I would like to leave DEV academy going into frontend development prioritising user interaction development in web development and also having a strong understanding of how new technology such as blockchain and smart contracts work and how they are changing the future. 
          </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h5>
          <p>
            Strengths - I still think that my learning style will be advantageous to bootcamp as I will be working with others and being shown live coding. This is beneficial as I learn best by seeing the affect each line of code has on the browser so I can then better understand the coding patterns. So once I see a piece of code on a project I can quite easily deduce its function and how most of it can work. However, I still struggle to figure out my coding process before starting my projects and I work best by starting and figuring out everything as I go. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately my weaknesses have not improved since the beginning of this course. In terms of learning weakness my visual dyslexia stills holds me back when having to read text and long explanations. This leaves me confused and unfocused which creates a mental strain creating negativity and self-doubt. To avoid this I try to remain positive and focus on small and quick tasks and provide visual results which boosts my confidence. Another weakness I have discovered during foundations has been my poor time management which I hope to improve on and develop an efficient process to assist me when needing to complete projects on time. 
          </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h5>
          <p>
            My biggest non-technical challenge during bootcamp I believe will be my mental endurance having to work, code and study for long periods of time. This could create a chain effect on my mental state slowing down my productivity and increasing my anxiety which would also lead to me struggling to work within a group.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I plan to avoid these strains by taking frequent breaks and keeping communication with my classmates and facilitators. Hopefully this will keep my mental state from spiralling.   
          </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h5>
          <p>
            I would like to improve my problem solving skills and forward thinking so that I can better pseudocode and planning out my code keeping it clean and understandable while also creating a solid plan to work with to not lose track of my process.   
          </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h5>
          <p>
            My expectations for bootcamp that the facilitators will show and help teach us new  ways of coding and more efficient techniques. While also allowing us the students to learn and solve problems on their own. In terms of providing support the facilitators will be watching over and available for assistance when the students require it.    
          </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h5>
          <p>
           Expectation of myself are that I will struggle and potentially even fail some projects but that will be fine because I will also thrive in some areas and provide assistance to those in my group during the projects with whatever competence I have.    
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope to work efficiently during the day amongst my cohort so that for the rest of the day I can relax and recover and take on the daily chores. Having less work to do after classes means more time to recover and reflect instead of spending time studying and over working my brain. This will allow me to be ready for the next day and be more productive. This will require me to maintain a strong focus during the day and remain attentive on the task at hand. So I will have less time to spend on stretch materials and focus on achieving the main goal and if there is time left over I can either help others or work on extra code and study that will help me to get ahead.

        <h1>Neuroplasicity and Growth mindset</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="article">
        <div>
          <h6>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h6>
            <p>
                Studies have shown that those who understand that the brain is malleable and changing escape a fixed mindset that lets them believe they are born with intelligence and cannot be worked on. By allowing kids to understand that the brain can change thy are more motivated to learn and put in the effort. Neuro-mythological barriers is a term used to define the mental blocks that hold people back from growing. These barriers are put in place subconsciously by ourselves due to the belief of not being able to do something so we put up barriers to stop training in these areas and over time they begin to solidify getting stronger and more difficult to breakdown. Much like the saying "can't teach on old dog new tricks" adults have tougher times trying to understand new information and adapt their thinking, especially if they believe that they don't have the ability to do so. This is why teaching kids in early school years about the concept of neuroplasticity can build more highways than barriers making them believe that they are smart enough or strong enough.
              </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h6>
            <p>
              The principles of neuroplasticity state that the brains functionality and shape can be grow, change and evolve through training and experiences. Most commonly the brain is trained sub-consciously so if we were to start training the brain to the way we want and full consciously then the brain would grow even faster. 
              Training the brain is the exact same as training any other muscle you’ve got to start off small get the technique right to train the right areas and then slowly increase the frequency and strain of the exercise. The more you exercise the stronger you get. Although the brain can't physically lift weights and run for a kilometre we can use it and challenge it by using mental situations.  Examples of mental challenges that can train the brain are things like, crossword puzzles, learning new skills travelling for new experiences and Video Gaming. Therefore to train my brain I engage with making new experiences to develop new neural pathways and learning new skills that help me to strengthen those neural pathways.
              </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h6>
            <p>
              Practice makes Perfect is a great technique for improving a brains neuroplasticity because the more we practice the more familiar we are with an activity and the better we can visualise to improve. Which brings us to another method to improving neuroplasticity, Visualisation. Visualisation allows your brains neuro signals to travel down those pathways without having to actually perform the task physically. Although the improvement is typically only 22% with visualisation an activity it is still very impressive considering that little physical movements are made.

        <h5>Growth Mindset</h5>
        <div>
          <h6>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h6>
            <p>
              A growth mindset is a mental state where a person can embrace change and new experiences and use them to improve and grow their own skills. As opposed to a fixed mindset where the person believes they are born with skills and no room for improvement denies change and new experiences. A growth mindset is very important because being able to accept advice, corrections and failure allows the person to learn from their mistake and improve their growing skill set.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h6>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h6>
              <p>
                During this exploration, I have found that there is a strong understanding as to what a growth mindset is and how we can influence children to take on a stronger growth mindset and prepare them which is amazing and will give them great opportunities to learn from in their future. However, it is a lot harder to change an adults mindset and being adults we learn the importance of a growth mindset and the impact it has but is much harder to develop one. So for those students less fortunate to develop a growth mindset in their younger years struggle later on as adults due to the lack of growth mindset influence strengthening neuropathways that  go against a growth mindset and therefore making it more difficult to change later on in life when they begin to realise the importance of a changing mindset.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h6>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h6>
              <p>
                Integrating a growth mindset into a learning journey is not easy for those who do not have a sub-conscious growth mindset. Being a person who's default mindset resorts to negativity and a more fixed mindset it takes more effort and control to maintain a growth mindset when learning new skills.  Therefore, to integrate a growth mindset into my learning to do my best to make the learning tasks enjoyable and make games out of them. Have clear small objectives and celebrate them as I go. While also acknowledging that I am going to fail somethings and not get everything correct but I can always try again, not forever but just till I get it right and understand that when I do I'll never get it wrong again.

              <p>
                My understanding of a growth mindset and neuroplasticity don't really affect my learning plan and strategy they merely assist with how I approach them. My learning plan is still the same and my goals are still the same its just that if a begin to steer of course ro stumble my understadning of my mind can help me get up and back on course to complete my learning.

        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      </div>
        <div class="article">
          <div>
            <h6>My definition of Emtional Intelligence</h6>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is the capacity to acknowledge and not act on emotions while also handling interpersonal relationship empathically and respectfully without judgment. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h6>Difference from IQ</h6>
            <p>Simply put the difference between IQ and EQ IQ is what we think, and EQ is how we think. IQ is the ability to solve problems, use logic, understand, and resolve complex ideas using one’s intelligence. Whereas EQ is the ability to recognize emotion absorb information without judgement and adapt your actions to emotion of yourself and others.</p>
            <p>The best visual example of this I find is a clip from the TV show young Sheldon when Sheldon and his twin sister (Missy) are begin tested and given the same test in different rooms.</p>
            <video controls="controls">
              <source src="/videos/Untitled.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
            </video>
            <p>As we can see in the video clip Sheldon excels with logical and mathematical problem solving and Missy excels at identifying the emotions of the apes shown in the picture and throughout the clip display emotional intelligence with the professor. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h6>Why is EQ important?</h6>
            <p>Benefits of emotional intelligence are that you’re it heightens ones understanding of themselves and others. This is a benefit because by understanding what emotions you are feeling and how to adapt to each one stops them from taking over and becoming confused and unfocused. For example, If you got angry you would be able to prevent yourself from lashing out, punching things, or even hurting people. Knowing when you are angry what can happen and how to avoid negative situations can be very advantageous when working on projects and problem solving.</p>
            <p>But there is also the ability to understand the emotions of others, recognising when someone is sad or angry, we can use emotional intelligence to help them adapt to their own emotions. Which can improve productivity within a workplace.</p>
            <p>A great example of the benefits of interpersonal skills is Elon Musk’s who openly states that “he would rather a group of slightly intelligent people who work well together rather than a group of highly intelligent people who do not work well together”. This is because the group who work well together can understand respect and acknowledge each other’s strengths and weaknesses leading to productivity. Whereas the group of highly intelligent people often have tendencies to prove their the smartest and will avoid work with others and not asking for help, slowing down productivity.</p>

            <p>My current plan is to gain a strong understanding and experience with software programming to eventually work remotely while travelling.</p>
            <p>Longer term i would like to be able to comfortable work with the thriving and innnovative new techologies that are rising such as Web 3, crypto, and metaverse</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h5>
          <p>When it comes to learning i have alwways been a more kenisthetic and auditorial learner. Meaning if i am too be shown how to do things and find it much easier to understand and put into practice. Unfortunately with these being my strengths one of my weaknesses in learning is more visual, typically when it comes to understand text and reading due to a visual dyslexia I have. however, i find that my best learning technique is repetition do things over and over again improves my memory and understanding of the subject.</p> 
          <p>Outside of learning techniques, so of my strengths and learning within a group and wokring with others face to face and also i have a good memory for things i perform practically. Whereas my weaknesses are that i never think i know enough, causing anxiety and worry about my wokr which is usually acceptable. This issue has caused some academic failures, but not due to incompetence but due to late submissions and having little confidence in my studies.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h5>
        <p>Greater confidence in my ability as a software programmer which would lead me to having less anxiety around others and when working for a company. Also the abiliity to accept imperfection and ask for help instead of spending wasted time researching results.</p> 
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h5>
      <h7>a. An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representative</h7><!--Was unsure how to answer this quesiton-->
      <p>By being respectful, helpful, and protray honesty in times of confusion allowing others to help.</p> 
      <h7>b. What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h7>
      <p>Much like this project issues and problems do happen and can frustrate me and during this week i attempted differnt methods of getting past the frustration. Most effective was stopping and going away from my computer and doingg exercise be it a walk and a quick surf at the beach. Then when i came back would look over my work, assess what i was trying to do, figure out best method of doing it and find the issues that occured.</p>
      <p>This method was most useful and enjoyable (I got smashed by waves) because it was something differnt and a nice break away from that which frustrated me.</p>

    <h5>5. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h5>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h5>6. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h5>
    <p>I have been trying to commit to 10-15min self research and trialing when it comes to an uncertain issue. if the issue is not resolved then i should be going to the discord channels asking other students for assistance. If not the facillitators if in a rush.</p> 
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5>7. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h5>
    <p>I expect the facilitators to be guiding their students through the sprint curriculums and ensuring that they comprhend and understand their tasks. While not always being in contact and relying on the students to teach the students is a very strong teaching method i believe that for the more shy beginners may struggle and take longer to embrace this learning style.</p> 
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5>8. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h5>
    <p>Day to day I aim for 8 hours of study and practice which is spilt into 2x 4 hour intervals seperated by lunch and exercise, smaller breaks when necesary.</p>
    <p>This leaves 8 hours left wihtin the day for extramurial activites such as house work and recreational activites (surfing). Typically about 2 hours of this time is commmited to any form of movement/exercise as to maintain physical helath.</p>
    <p>In the case of not completeing the necesary hours of study. some late afternoon study may be required. as well as in the event of a day off for a little rest and relaxation. or even in the case of too much study so time on the next day may be taken out to  aintain a helahty worklife balance.</p>

          <h6>Connection</h6>

            <p>What I think this value means connections with others be them friends’ family or colleagues. Connection creates a sense of belonging, inclusion and unity with those around me while having a safeguard feeling that there are others to support and assist me when I struggle. </p>

            <p>This value I believe originates from a human instinct but also having siblings gave a long sense of always having someone with me and always doing activities with others and therefore created a desire for connection away from home. </p>

           <p class="center quote">Albert Einstein <em>“The only source of knowledge is Experience”</em></p>

            <p>This quote summarises what it means to gain experiences both good and bad. Much like learning from mistakes every experience always has a lesson to teach no matter how small.</p>

          <h6>Respect</h6>

           <p>I value respect, respect towards others and self-respect not only due to its nature of kindness, honesty, and compassion towards others but also how it impacts oneself. By respecting myself I sense a stronger obligation to improving wellbeing and enjoying more of what life has to offer. </p> 

           <p>This value I believe is to be derived from the way I was raised and experiencing situations where lack of respect creates situations such as bullying, negative self-talk, misunderstandings and creates a domino effect towards hate and disrespect.</p>
          
            <p class="center quote">Martin Luther King <em>”I am convinced that men hate each other because they fear each other. They fear each other because they don’t know each other and they don’t know each other because they don’t communicate with each other, and they don’t communicate with each other because they are separated from each other.”</em></p>

          <h6>Knowledge</h6>
            <p>Knowledge can be gained from many different teachers, be it primary education, librarians, workplace colleagues, experiences, time, knowledge can be gathered a every turn. I collect knowledge as a tool to help raise myself above struggle and conflict towards a resolution efficiently and productively. However, the versatility of knowledge can be used as a tool, or a weapon and it is up to the wielder to decide which. as a tool it can be used to build a rocket to reach the stars or to collect information about an enemy’s plan and decide best course of action for best outcomes.</p>
            <p>I gather knowledge to be resourceful, adaptable, intelligent and understanding because these traits make it possible for me to best help others and provide positive experiences and resolutions. Therefore, I use knowledge as a tool to assist those around me and therefore be my better self.</p>

          <h6>Adventure</h6>	
            <p>Adventure has always been a strong value of mine, and to mean adventure means getting out and exploring new experiences and being active. Adventure also provides a sense of unity and connection with the earth which I believe comes from the primal human nature.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="value">
            <h6>Independence</h6>	
            <p>Despite having the stronger Connection Value, I also value those that can be	 independent and can do things on their own. Those that are independent don’t require assistance from others all the time and have the capabilities of performing tasks, and if they aren’t capable, they know how to become capable.</p>

            <h6>Limtiations</h6>
              <p>Anxiety around new people. Sometimes afraid to ask for help, visual dyslexia processing large amounts of text. Struggle with interpretation of some sentences but as soon as sound it out or talk it over can comprehend well.</p>

            <h6>Ethical Decision</h6>
            <p>A strong ethical decision we all must make is where we want to go in life and what we want to do. These decisions have many different influences from various sources such as family friends, government, laws, and of course personal <br>
              For example. For a long time during high school, I always wanted to work in the adventure tourism industry because I would be required o do physical work and have fun jumping of cliffs, riding down mountains and being in nature. This fed my Balance, Adventure, Experience and Connection values. <br>
                Because of these values I then choose to attend a Tertiary study programme that would better equip myself to join and thrive in the industry. This led me to researching and experiencing what different tertiary programmes had to offer and I needed to decide which one best suited me and lined up with my values. <br>
              My 3 choices became Otago Uni, Queenstown Resort College (QRC) and New Zealand School of Tourism (NZST). Each provided me with strong Experience and knowledge of the industry which aligned with two of my values. <br>
              <br>Otago – focus on the skills of the outdoor adventure guide for kayaking, rock climbing, tramping, skiing – all great areas that would allow me to travel, meet and learn with likeminded people (Adventure and Connection) <br>
              <br>NZST – focus on extreme outdoor sports and extreme conditions, smaller course intake (less connection, narrow experience, independence) <br>
              <br> QRC – focus on Adventure Tourism more about how to run a tourism business - marketing, HR, business financials plus experience in a huge variety of outdoor pursuits (adventure, independence, connection). It offered a more whole person and whole business opportunity. <br>
              <br>After weighing my personal values and the values I would get out of each provider, I decided to go with QRC as it aligned with more of my values allowing for the best fit. <br>

          <h6>Personal Experience of handling tension wihtin a group </h6>
          <p>During my time at Cromwell College, I participated in a programme called B.L.A.S.T. which was essentially a way to give high school students a military experience. Doing drills, marching practice, and circuit physical training. towards the end of this programme we were all spilt into small groups of 6-7 and were to run a orientation course across the time for most of the day. I, being the eldest in the programme was given the task of Team Leader and given the more troublesome students. The ones that would not get along with anyone and rebel as often as they could. Some may think this was unfair, but the head teacher and I had already discussed this plan as to not allow these students to disrupt the other groups. </p>
          <p>Now during the orientation activity these students consistently argued and fought and were being very disruptive, not allowing us to complete tasks or move efficiently. Unfortunately, i did have not use a more aggressive leadership style and tell the students what to do instead of suggesting and assign tasks appropriately. Once I had separated the two more troublesome students and given them simplistic and meaningful tasks such as setting the speed of the group and giving the best direction. </p>
          <p>The techniques I used to handle the tension and conflict within the group was to give everyone their own tasks away from each other to avoid collisions. Unfortunately I did have to take away the students right to speak up because he had lost the trust and reliance of his team mates.</p>
          <p>These methods to stop the disruptive behaviour of the students was surprisingly effective and to not only our teams surprise by the surprise of all those watching our team managed to win the orientation and complete the course much more efficiently than the other teams. Reflecting on how I acted in that situations I’m proud that I was able to take charge more firmly and get the students to start working productively. However, I did not enjoy having to be angry with the students and taking away their opportunities to speak up.</p>
